<p>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is particularly useful when it comes to game design, not only due to the easiness to
organize and collaborate, but due to games’ inherent nature--the interaction between different objects!</p>

<p>Because this method of programming focuses on the creation of objects along with its attributes and behaviors, we are
able to easily work with different objects within the game in organized manner. Furthermore, with the power of
inheritance and interaction between the different classes and their subclasses, it prevents things such as repetition in
code, because you can easily reuse and/or override methods that you’ve written under those classes.
</p>

<p>An important thing to note is that that we are able to split our code into multiple files. Each file would usually
comprise of its own class, and with a certain syntax, we are able to make all of the classes within our program interact
with one another as if they are in the same file.</p>

<p>In order to do this, you have to make sure that the files comprised of your different classes are within the same
directory or folder. By doing so, you could import one or more classes’ components onto that of another file containing
a different class, allowing you to utilize features from those imported class.</p>

<pre>
        <code class="hljs livecodeserver">
import pygame as pg

from Obstacles import Obstacle

class Game:

# num_lanes: How many total lanes is wanted in this game, minimum is two for start and end lanes. includes start, end
and traffic lanes
# num_lives: Game over when this number reaches 0

def __init__(self, num_lanes, num_lives):
self.lanes = {key:[] for key in range(0,num_lanes)}
self.num_lives = num_lives
    </code>
        </pre>

<p>As you can see, in the Game.py file, we could utilize components from the Obstacles class by including “from Obstacles
import Obstacle,” where “Obstacles” is the Obstacles.py file and “Obstacle” is the name of the class. If you want to
import everything from a particular file or even a library such as pygame, you would simply type “from pygame import *”.</p>

<p>And voila! You have access to the different methods and instances (objects) of that imported class, allowing for
efficient interaction between the different classes!</p>

<p>Ultimately, it is up to you and your design to decide which classes are necessary, and what methods and instance
variables should each class have. Good design decisions could make your game more manageable and easier to debug.
However, it is completely ok if your first design turns out unsatisfactory - it often takes several iterations to
achieve the optimal design, so do not be afraid to make modifications to your design as you work on the project.</p>

<p>We hope that Frogger could give you an idea as to how you can break down a complex game and organize each component into
a class. We want to emphasize that there are multiple ways of doing this, and in no way is our way the correct answer;
therefore, as you read through the rest of this guide, think about how you could have organized things differently!</p>

<p>For Frogger, we decided that three game components should have their own classes - frog (player), obstacle, and lanes
(Game.py). Before diving into the actual code. Let’s think about how these components should be able to handle and how
they should interact.</p>

<p>For our frog, we want to make sure that it can move in 4 different directions given keyboard inputs; we would like to
return the frog to its starting position if it collided with an obstacle; we want the frog to identify that it has made
it across all the traffic lanes safely; and finally, we need to display the frog.</p>

<p>For each obstacle, it should be able to move at varying speeds; it should be able to detect that it has moved past the
edges of the screen and signal that; and it should be displayed on screen.</p>

<p>For lanes, we want the Game class to keep track of all the obstacles that are currently in each lane as well as to
display how many lives remain. In terms of interactivity, we would expect the frog to interact with obstacles (collision
detection) and the Game class to interact with instances of the Obstacle class.</p>

<pre>
        <code class="hljs livecodeserver">
import pygame as pg
import pygame.freetype as freetype
import random
import os
from Game import Game
from Frog import Frog
from Obstacles import Obstacle



# Simple pygame program
screen_width = 700
screen_height = 600
num_lanes = 4

# Import and initialize the pygame library
pg.init()

# Set up the drawing window
screen = pg.display.set_mode([screen_width,screen_height])

f_game = Game(4,3)

</code>
    </pre>

<p>With the big picture set, let’s look more closely at the code. In particular, we will focus on how the Obstacle class
and Game class interact. In the game loop in main.py, a new Game object is created, and obstacles are created and stored
into game.lanes.</p>

<pre>
        <code class="hljs livecodeserver">
class Game:

# num_lanes: How many total lanes is wanted in this game, minimum is two for start and end lanes. includes start, end
and traffic lanes
# num_lives: Game over when this number reaches 0

def __init__(self, num_lanes, num_lives):
self.lanes = {key:[] for key in range(0,num_lanes)}
self.num_lives = num_lives

</code>
    </pre>

<p>Game.lanes is a dictionary that maps a lane number to a list of obstacle objects. This allows us to
keep track of which obstacles are on the screen at any given time by iterating through the lists stored in Game.lanes,
meaning that removing obstacles when they are at the edges of the screen and checking for collision will be easy. To
make things even more convenient for ourselves, we give each Obstacle object instance variables, lane_number and
lane_index. With these two variables we can access all the information about an obstacle through
Game.lanes[lane_number][lane_index].</p>

<p>Now, consider if we had not split up the code into different classes. It could become overwhelming to think about all
obstacles that you have to keep track of and all the things you need to check for. However, by creating an Obstacle
class, we only need to think about what a single Obstacle object needs to do. Similarly, the Game class gives us a
useful data structure for storing all the Obstacle objects. Again, there is a lot of flexibility in design. For example,
we could have chosen a different data structure to implement Game.lanes; or we could have made each lane into a class;
or we could have asked each Obstacle to check if it is colliding with the Frog, but we chose to give Frog that
responsibility instead.</p>

<p>We hope that this guide helps you see the importance and intricacy of design and gets you started on thinking about how
you could componentize your final project!</p>
